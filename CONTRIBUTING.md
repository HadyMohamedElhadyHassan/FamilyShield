# Contributing to FamilyShield

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/HadyMohamedElhadyHassan/FamilyShield/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
